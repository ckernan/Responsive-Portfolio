      <img src="assets/images/gypsywitchfiesta.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p style="text-indent: 20px">Originally from O'Fallon, Missouri, I moved to Austin in 2006 to attend the University of Texas where I studied biochemistry.
        I have since worked in organic chemistry and most recently dental insurance. I am now looking forward to a career
        change into the field of technology which is why I decided to enroll in the UT coding bootcamp.
      </p>

      <p style="text-indent: 20px"> My interests include film, hiking and music. Most of all, I am a huge fan of DOGS! I have two chihuahua daughters named
        Rubita and Gypsy Witch and I love them more than anything in the world :).</p>
